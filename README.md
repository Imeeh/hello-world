Advancing My Parallel Programming Skill Sets

On a personal level, I am detail-oriented, organized, and precise in my work; I have strong communication skills with a knack for clear and illuminating presentation. I’m comfortable on my own facing the numbers, but I really enjoy being part of a motivated team of smart people.

I possess an advantageous professional network and managerial capacity to handle project planning from requirements gathering through to writing and testing code and creating documentation and support.
